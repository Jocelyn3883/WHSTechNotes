My thoughts on the phone law. I don't aggree with it because what is there is an emergngey, and my parents need to get a hold of me they aren't going to call the office and ten wait for me to go and then talk to me. I also don't aggree because if i have an emergency i can't call anyone i have o go all the way to the office. I honestly just think its a safty hazerd not to have them.
